Features of Angular:

1.Two way Data binding : changes is automatically updated in the component class 
2.Powerful Routing Support :
3.Expressive HTML :control and render HTML pages
4.Modular by design
5.Built-in Back end Support 
6. Active Community.


Installling and setting up an angular Development   

1. Angular requires knowledge of javascript ,HTML & CSS
2. Install NODE-JS and NPM 
3. Install VS_Code 
4. Install Angular CLI : this is a basic system that is required to develop an application 
   

Angular CLI:
  Angular command line interface 




Performed in terminal :
node -v
npm -v
npm install upper-case
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng v      // to find the version of angular in ur pc 
ng new  AngularApp5   // to create a new angular project 
ng s      or ng serve


Angular CLI does the following :
1.create a new directory AngularApp5
2. Sets up the folder structure for the application 
3. Download and install angular librsries and any other dependencies
4.Install and configures Typescript
5.Install and configures Karma & Protactor for testing 

Angular project folder structure:

.editorconfig : this is congfiguration file for the visual studio code editor 

.gitignore : Git configuration to make sure auto generated files are not commited to source control //completely related to git where we  control some whch are not commited 

.angular.json: this is the configuartion file for angular CLI.

browserlist : Ensures the compatibility of the angular app with different browsers.

 karma.conf.js : the configuration file forthe karma test runner 

package.json : the package.json is an npm configuration file , that lists the third party packages that your project depends on

tscongig.json ,tsconfig.app.json & tsconfig.spec.json are typescript configuration files.
 the tsconfig.json is the typescript compiler configuration file .this file  specifies the compileroptions required for the typescript to compile the project .the tsconfig.app.json is used for compiling the code while tsconfig.spec.json for compiling the tests

e2e :
this floder contains the files required for end to end tests by protactor. protactor allows us to test our application against a real browser 

To check version of angular :
ng v

Adding new port : to change port 
 ng serve --port 4401 
 ng s -o --port=4401 

to run default port :
ng serve --open
ng serve -o

To run :
ng serve ----to start
ng build ----to build
ng test  ----to test

To install bootstrap :
npm i bootstrap 

component :
1. The app.component.ts is the component that is added to the project by Angukar ClI .you will find it under the folder app/src
2. The component class is the most important part of our application .it repersent the view othe application 
3. a view is a region on th screen .It consists of three main parts i.e a classs, class decortor and an import statement


Import statement :
The import statement is used to import the libraries that are used in pur component class 


app.component.ts:  

A. selector :
1.App slector   --- app
2. class selector   ---- .app-root  add dot (.)
3. attribute selector  ---  [app-root]   add the name of attribute in square brackets []
    attribute +value --- div[app=app1]

B. templateURL
  1.inline template  : using this we can have multiple line of html code in app.component.ts  `` 
  2.external template : 
C. styleURL

templateURL : view of application 

Root Module :
1. Angular organizes the application as angular modules .The modules are closely related blocks of code in functionality .Every application must have at least one module 
2. The module which loads first is the root module 
3.The root module is called app.module.ts
4.The structure of the angular module is similar to the component class  like component it consist of three parts class, class decorator and import statement 

Boostrapping our root module :
the app.component.html is the file which we need to show it the user .it is bound to Appcomponent component . we indicated that the AppComponent is to be bootstrapped when Appmodule is loaded

styleUrl : what style we have added to application


index.html file :
index.html is entry point of pur application 


style.css:
what ever the change made in style.css it will apply to whole application 
it is the global style sheet of angular application 




components in angular :
the angular applications will have lots of components 
These components work together toproduce the complete user interface of the application 

the components consists of three main building blocks 
1. Template
2. Class
3. MetaData 


1. template : 
the template defines he layout of the view and  defines ht is rendered on the page .
template is nothing but a HTML 
two type:
    1.template inline 
    2.external template





Data Binding :
 *data binding is a technique where the data stays in sync between the component and the view 

*user upadte the data in the view ,angular updates the component .when the component gets new data ,the angular updates the view 
 * the data binding in angular canbe broadly classified into two groups 
     1.One way binding 
     2. Two way binding 


One way binding: in one way binding data flows from one drection .Either from view to component or from component to view 

*from component to view :  to bind  data from component we,amke use of inetrpolaton and property binding 
* from view to component : we make use of event binding 


Interpolation :
{{}} -> double curly brackets for interpolation 
{{templateExpression}}
anguar first evaluates the Template Expression and converts it into  a string .then it replaces 
template expression with the result inthe original string in HTML .
whenever the template expression changes the angular updates the original string again 
Interpolation not work with  non string types 


Attribute and properties :
Attribute and properties are not same 
Attribute are defined by html 
Properties are defined by DOM(document object model)
Attributes initialize DOM properties and they are done .
Attributes values cannont change once they are defined 

property values can change 
Property-Binding :
 
check in console :
input property:
$0.getAttribute("value")
'Konverge'
$0.value
'Konverge ai'


default component called -> app component
Inside app component :
->app.component.css  = work with style
->app.component.html  =template view 
->app.component.ts     = typescript file contains data 
->app.component.spec.ts   =testing file
-> app.module.ts    = root module of application 

to generator module :
ng g module station-operator 

To genrate component inside  module :

ng g c station-operator/station-operator
To generate component = ng g  c "nameofcomponent"
               example := ng g c employee
ng ->  for angular cli
g-> for generate
c-> for component

This employee component are generated in app floder 
upadte app.mosule.ts : becoz this root module
by executing this : cli create 4 default files :
employee.component.css
employee.component.html
employee.component.ts
employee.component.spec.ts

Angular event binding : one of the data binding technique
class binding:  classname ,class,ngclass
style binding
event binding 

API:Application programming interface
react,javascript,angular can not connect directly to database so we need interface to connect it 
so we require api to provide the data frm database

SCSS -> Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet
SCSS is the more advanced version of CSS



tabulator:
jasmine
karma


function:
function in angular: dont use keyword function 
we not use name it will show error becoz angular 13 has a strict mode = "true "
 to avoid this use the type or mentioned the type of that variable (feature of typescript)

 getname(){
   alert("hello konverge")
 }
 getname2(name1:string){
   alert(name1)
 }

we also can use any type :

 getname(){
   alert("hello konverge")
 }
 getname1(name1:string){
   alert(name1)
 }
   getname2(name:any){
   alert(name)
 }
  


having two types in  either or 
two or many type u want to define then use any that will be better 
<button neewee-primary-btn (click)="getname()" class="btn-1">Dashboard</button>
<button neewee-primary-btn (click)="getname1('Schedule')"class="btn-2">Schedule</button>
<button neewee-primary-btn (click)="getname2('587')">Add new sheets</button>

buttton in angular :

<button neewee-primary-btn (click)="getname()" class="btn-1">Dashboard</button>
<button neewee-primary-btn (click)="getname1('Schedule')"class="btn-2">Schedule</button>
<button neewee-primary-btn (click)="getname2('587')">Add new sheets</button>

<app-button (click ="getname()")>Dashboard 
</app-button>
<app-button (click ="getname1('Schedule')")>Schedule
</app-button>
<app-button (click ="getname2('587')")>Add new sheets
</app-button>
  


Events:

module -> component->pipes->directive 

pipes in angular :
how to format the data -> which should display in that template 
angular pipe takes data as input n formats or transform the data to dislay in the template 

* change the apperance of the data before presenting in template

syntax :
 Expression | pipeOperator[:pipeArgumment]

type of pipes:
lowercase
uperacse
json
slice
titlecase
percent
number
currency
date


headerSort: false 




    height: calc(100vh - 92px); -> by default overflow set hogaya

*ngIf :if else conditon
 
Difference between [hidden]='false'   and *ngIf='false' is that the first mothod simply hides the elemnt 
the second method  with ngif removes the element completely from the DOM 

hidden  does not remove the element from the DOM .But it just hides it.

ngIf does not hide DOM element .it removes the entire elemnet along with its subtree from the DOM. it also removes the corresponding state freeing up the resources attached to the element


ngModel: The ngModel directive is used the achieve the two way data binding 

ngClass : the ngClass is used to add or remove the CSS classes from an HTML  element .Using the ngClass one can create dynamic styles in HTMl pages
